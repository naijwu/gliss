some thoughts: potentially make the budgets shareable? and allow other users to occupy a row (either an expense or income) for collaborative budgeting (because in some cases large expenses are shared -- e.g. having a roommate)? whats the most lightweight way I can encode the data (make a function to encode stringified json data into a hash + attach a top hash which would be accessed first in the decryption in order to check if the data should be accessed/viewable? e.g. my.gliss.to/{hash here} can be the actual page where you can edit your finances, etc., and your.gliss.to/{hash here} can be for accessing another person's monthly budgeting/'gliss table')? purpose of encoding data that way would be for lightweight sharing -- can share your monthly expenses/income to trusted frens and have them offer ways to optimize your finances? and locally saving data can be easier: a .txt with just a hash, or just present a hash to the user that represents the data so they can just put it in their notes or something... maybe my current high-level understanding of hashes are wrong and everything I just said would be impractical? hotel? trivago? i-
